# BraTS-Challenge
Bachelor's thesis at Novosibirsk State University: Brain tumor segmentation and prediction of patient state using data from http://braintumorsegmentation.org/. 

The project included two tasks.

1) Brain Tumor Segmentation:
The segmentation of brain tumors was successfully executed, achieving Dice coefficient of 0.818. This outcome underscores the precision and accuracy of the model.

2) Prediction of Patient's Lifespan Interval:
The second task involved predicting the time interval of a patient's life, employing segmentation features for multi-class classification. The model demonstrated its predictive capability with an F1 metric of 0.586. This metric reflects the model's proficiency in classifying different lifespan intervals, highlighting its potential for valuable clinical applications.

The project's code can be found in the accompanying notebooks and a detailed explanation of the tasks, solutions, and results can be found in the paper, which is currently only available in Russian.
