# BraTS-Challenge
Bachelor graduation project from Novosibirsk State University: Brain tumor segmentation and prediction of patient state using data from http://braintumorsegmentation.org/. 

The project included two tasks: (1) segmentation of brain tumors, which was accomplished with a Dice coefficient of 0.818, and (2) prediction of the time interval of a patient's life using segmentation features (multi-class classification) with an F1 metric of 0.586. 

The project's code can be found in the accompanying notebooks and a detailed explanation of the tasks, solutions, and results can be found in the paper, which is currently only available in Russian.
